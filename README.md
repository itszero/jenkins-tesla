My personal Tesla data-logger. The source code is provided as-is with no support.

The only thing of interest in the code is probably the sleep mode implementation. It roughly follows [TeslaFi](https://support.teslafi.com/knowledge-bases/2/articles/640-enabling-sleep-settings-to-limit-vampire-loss) documentation.
